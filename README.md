An overview of the SHLang specification can be seen [here](doc/contents.md).

## Requirements
The user is to implement a compiler and an interpreter for SHLang.
The use of lexer/parser generation tools or the usage of another user's submission is prohibited.

## Testing
In the project's root directory, invoke Lua 5.3 to run the file `src/main.lua`.

## Contributing
The user may file an issue for the following reasons:
- to report meta issues (e.g. code/documentation clarity, conciseness, consistency, formatting, etc.),
- to report technical issues (e.g. runtime errors, logic errors, etc.),
- and to suggest changes to the SHLang specification.

The user may create a pull request for the following reasons:
- to fix an issue (see above),
- and to contribute additional tests and test cases.

## Submitting
The user's submission is judged solely based on the amount of passing test cases.
